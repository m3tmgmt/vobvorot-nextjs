# ✅ SECURITY CLEANUP COMPLETED

## 1. Git History Cleaned ✅
I've removed the following files from Git history:
- `vobvorot-api-keys.json` (contained Supabase API keys)
- `debug-token.js` (contained Telegram bot token)
- `verify-bot-token.js` (contained Telegram bot token)
- `setup-supabase-vobvorot.sh` (contained Supabase Bearer token and password)

## 2. Force Push Completed ✅
Secrets have been removed from GitHub with:
```bash
git push --force origin main
```

## 3. Decision on Exposed Secrets ✅

Per user decision, the existing keys will continue to be used as they were not compromised quickly enough.

## 4. Current Status ✅
- Git history cleaned locally and on GitHub
- Secrets removed from repository
