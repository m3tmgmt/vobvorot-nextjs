# Railway Deployment Status Report

## Current Status: READY FOR MANUAL DEPLOYMENT üü°

### Project Configuration ‚úÖ
- **Repository**: https://github.com/m3tmgmt/vobvorot-nextjs
- **Railway Project**: quixotic-liquid (Project ID: c5bb102b-c630-4e60-86d1-c8f3d42c7f3f)
- **Environment**: production
- **CLI Authentication**: ‚úÖ Authenticated as m3t.mgmt@gmail.com

### Files Ready for Deployment ‚úÖ

### Technical Limitations Encountered üö´
The Railway CLI requires interactive input for service creation, which cannot be automated in this environment:
- `railway add` requires TTY for service selection
- `railway up` requires a service to be linked first
- GitHub integration must be configured through Railway dashboard

### Next Steps Required (Manual) üîß

#### 1. Visit Railway Dashboard
**URL**: https://railway.app/dashboard
- Navigate to **quixotic-liquid** project
- Click **"Add Service"**
- Select **"GitHub Repository"**
- Choose **"m3tmgmt/vobvorot-nextjs"**

#### 2. Configure GitHub Integration
- Set branch to **"main"**
- Railway will auto-detect Next.js
- nixpacks.toml will be used automatically

#### 3. Set Environment Variables
Copy from `.env.railway` file (already prepared):
- Database connections (Prisma Accelerate)
- Authentication secrets (NextAuth)
- Payment gateway (WesternBid mock)
- Email service (Resend)
- Image hosting (Cloudinary)
- Analytics (Google Analytics)
- Bot integration (Telegram)

#### 4. Deploy
- Click **"Deploy"** in Railway dashboard
- Monitor build logs
- Verify deployment success

### Expected Deployment Results üìä

#### Build Configuration
```bash
Build Command: npm ci && npx prisma generate && npm run build
Start Command: npm start
Node Version: 20.x
Environment: production
```

#### Deployment URL
- **Railway URL**: `https://[service-name]-production-[hash].up.railway.app`

2. Add custom domain `vobvorot.com` in Railway dashboard
3. Update DNS records as instructed by Railway

### Monitoring & Health Checks üìà
Available endpoints:
- `/api/health` - Application health
- `/api/products` - Products API
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard
- `/` - Main application

### Security Configuration üîí
- Environment variables properly configured
- Payment gateway in secure mock mode
- API rate limiting enabled
- CSRF protection configured
- Secure session management

## Alternative Deployment Methods üîÑ

### Option 1: Railway Web Interface (Recommended)
Follow the `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for complete instructions.

### Option 2: Railway CLI (After Service Creation)
Once service is created manually:
```bash
railway service [service-name]
railway variables set --from-file .env.railway
railway deploy
```

### Option 3: Railway API (Advanced)
Use Railway's GraphQL API at `https://backboard.railway.com/graphql/v2`
