  experimental: {
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['lodash', 'cloudinary'],
  }
};
```

- `patch-lodash.js` - Build compatibility fix

### 3. **Automation Script Patterns**
```javascript
// Pattern: Comprehensive error handling with status reporting
function executeCommand(command, description, continueOnError = false) {
  try {
    log(`üîß ${description}...`, 'cyan');
    const result = execSync(command, { stdio: 'pipe', encoding: 'utf8' });
    success(`${description} completed`);
    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    if (continueOnError) {
      warning(`${description} failed but continuing: ${err.message}`);
      return null;
    } else {
      error(`Failed: ${err.message}`);
      throw err;
    }
  }
